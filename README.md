# obsidian_notes

My personal code for turning my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes into a website. Extremely incomplete and hacked together, but feel free to take anything useful from it.

You can visit the site at http://notes.billmill.org

I deploy this with `make publish`, run via a github action in my notes repo.
